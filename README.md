This is a great repository.
Hi Everyone, 
My name is John E Pizzini. I am currently a student at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, CA.
I am persuing an Associate Degree in Theatre Arts for transfer to a 4 year University.
I ain't that good lookin, cuz I've been up on a shelf, but I have a sweet disposition and
I like to enjoy myself. Plus, I have a very sociable cat. What are the chances of that?
